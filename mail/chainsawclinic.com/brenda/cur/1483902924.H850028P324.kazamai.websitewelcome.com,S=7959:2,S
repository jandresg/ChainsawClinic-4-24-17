Dear Brothers
I would like to bring up a matter for your attention regarding our
Bethelites. In view of our Sunday 3:30pm meetings, it would be an
expression of kindness and brotherly love if we were to invite them for a
meal after the meetings.

Consider a typical Sunday. They come out for service at 10:30 (after a
45min drive). They bring a lunch for before the meeting. Then after the
meeting, they arrive "home" at around 6:30 However, on Sunday, the kitchen
at Bethel closes at 6pm, too late for our Bethelites. At that time, they
only have pre-prepared frozen meals they could obtain. So after arriving
"home", they would have to acquire a meal to re-heat or have something
already prepared. By then they have had at least an 8hr day serving the
territory and the congregation. And they all have to start work the next
day at 8am like many of us do.

Hospitality is defined as a love of strangers. The Bethelites are certainly
no strangers to us, they are our family. So could we think of them and have
them for a meal before they have to return to Bethel. No doubt this also
will brings a great exchange of encouragement.

Thank you for your consideration of this.

John Parete
