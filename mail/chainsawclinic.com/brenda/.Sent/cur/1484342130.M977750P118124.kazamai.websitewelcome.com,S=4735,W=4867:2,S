Hi Larry, Going back to when we sold the property, there were funds that
Dad never got back because there was not enough money received when we
sold the property, we had to pay off Ron and Joanna with Interest and Sue
with Interest. I would have to look up the amount but I think its at least
20 Thousand.

Also there are the security fee that the City of Toronto took approx.
13-14 Thousand that Chain Saw Clinic never gotten back from the City.. So
approx. 30-35 Thousand 

 

Is there a way that  by transferring 2020209 debt to CSC we can eventually
pay off Dad for these losses.

Im checking before we close the 2020209 with the Ontario government to
make sure.

 

The Purchase of the property was for Chain Saw Clinic in the first place.

Please let me know what you think

Thanks

Brenda

Have a nice weekend

I should have the T4 info ready for you next week.
